	<h1>Positioning Blocks</h1>
	<div>
		(1) By default, blocks of text just folow each other
	</div>
	<div>
		(2) One after another.
	</div>
	<div style="position: relative; left: -16px; top: 20px">
		(3) A relative position moves a block away from where it would normally lay out.
	</div>
	<div>
		(4) And text after that just lays out. So be somewhat careful with relative.
	</div>
	<div style="border-color: green; position: fixed; bottom: 20px; left: 30%">
		(5) Fixed text is relative to the window. It maintains its position even when the window is resized or scrolled. A 
		<a href="index.html">link</a>
		that never goes away.
	</div>
	<div style="border-color: yellow; position: absolute; top: 40px; left: 30%">
		(6) Absolute text is relative to its parent element. In this case the <b>div</b> is positioned relative to the <b>body</b> tag. It maintains its position even when the window is resized or scrolled.
	</div>
	<div>
		(7) In a sense, the <b>fixed</b> and <b>absolute</b> elements are "plucked out" of the the normal render stream and as such take up no vertical space. there is not any padding or margin left behind by these tags.
	</div>
	<div style="border-color: yellow; position: relative; left: -1000px">
		(8) Where did this text go?
	</div>
	<div style="border-color: yellow">
		(9) Why can't I see (8) but it took up space?
	</div>
</body>
