		<h1 style="color: blue">An Overview Of CSS</h1>
		<p>
			These pages are intended to be explored in the developer console of your browser. You should also install the
			<a href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/" target="_blank">Web Developer</a> plugin from Chris Pedrick to play with CSS.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can use the <b>style = </b>attributes on HTML Tags to apply various styles to text and blocks of text.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: monospace;">
			The "Cascading" in CSS means that the closest style setting (monospace) "wins" over a syle setting (arial) that is "further away".
		</p>
		<p style="border-style: solid; border-color: red; border-width: 5px;">
			We can put a border around a block of text. You probably want a CSS cheat sheet handy or use Google to search to find CSS values.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the <b>style</b> attribute works, it leads to overly verbose HTML so it is more typical to write CSS <a href="rules.html"> &rArr; style rules</a> to apply styles to many tags at once.
