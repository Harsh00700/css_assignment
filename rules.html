		You put a set of rules in a &lt;style&gt; tag, and they are applied to parts of the documents that match the selectors.
	</p>
	<p style="border-style: solid; border-color: red; border-width: 5px;">
		After a while we end up with far too many CSS rules to put in the &lt;head&gt; area of each document. A simpler way to include a large number of CSS rules is to put them in a separate file and <a style="color: green; background-color: lightgray; text-decoration: none;" href="include.html"> &rArr; include that file</a> that file in each of the pages.
